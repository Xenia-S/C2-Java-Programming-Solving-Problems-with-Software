# [Java Programming Solving Problems with Software](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming?specialization=java-programming)

This course is offered at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and is a second course of the [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming).

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

Some code should be run in a custom Bluej Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. You can get the IDE from the [University website](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/bluej.php?course=2).
